# Custom List
This is an example to practice implementation of interfaces and testing.

## Assignment
- The interface to implement is `com.engeto.customlist.CustomList`. Do not change it.
- Test is in `com.engeto.customlist.CustomListTest`. Feel free to add more tests if you need to.
- I suggest creating a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list).
- You will need to implement additional classes, not just the `CustomList`.
